run_analysis.R is the R script to do the following data cleaning work:
1) Reads the training data and test data separately and merge them into one whole dataset
2) Shrinks the volume of this new dataset by only selecting the variables associated with the mean and standard deviation measurements
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data sets
4) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each selected variable for each activity and each participant
